            <h3>LEARN HOW IT ALL STARTED FOR AMA</h3>
            <p>
              Josh York started the AMA business in 2008. However, it was many
              years prior that he began creating the path that would lead to a
              successful mobile personal training business.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2007, after graduating from college, Josh began working for a
              marketing firm and continued working as a personal trainer in the
              evenings. It was on one of these evenings at the gym that
              something clicked. He noticed that gym members were inconsistent.
              Whether his clients were working late, unable to leave the house
              after a busy day, or just needed to get dinner on the table, Josh
              realized that there are dozens of rational reasons why many people
              aren’t consistent gym-goers. This is when he started developing a
              solution.
            </p>
            <h3>BRINGING IDEAS TO LIFE</h3>
            <p>
              Josh created AMA from an idea and, like many great entrepreneurs,
              he started the AMA business in his parents’ house in 2008. The
              dining room became a mini AMA office. He started with a vision, a
              laptop, and one van. He conducted business at the dining room
              table with a cordless phone and one folder with a few client
              names.
            </p>
            <p>
              Josh was not only running the business, but he was training the
              clients as well. When not training his clients, Josh drove the AMA
              van every day, up and down the Long Island Expressway, in an
              effort to market the AMA brand and attract new clients. Soon that
              one folder became multiple files, and the dining room became
              crowded with file cabinets, a printer, a fax machine, and
              marketing materials.

            <h3>WHY CHOOSE AMA ?</h3>
            <p>
              Achieving fitness goals is not easy. Knowing how to exercise,
              finding time to exercise, and keeping motivated are common
              challenges. Getting yourself to the gym may feel much more
              overwhelming than actually working towards your goal. To lose
              weight or increase fitness levels, it’s time to try something
              different. AMA can help you achieve the results you want!
